# Problem #4: Largest palindrome product
# ======================================
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
# palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
# 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two
# 3-digit numbers.
